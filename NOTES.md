# Smashing the Stack for fun and profit - Aleph1

As a starting exercise, I am trying to recreate the examples and exploits from the original paper.
The compiler flags for `gcc` generally used are `-m32 -fno-stack-protector -z execstack -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=0`.
Without those, current stack overflow mitigation measures do not allow to successfully overflow the buffers on the stack as described in the paper.

## example3.c
The executable only provided a segfault because the return address was incorrectly overwritten (checked with `gdb`).
In order to correctly overwrite the return address, it is necessary to change the offset from `buffer1` from `12` to `13`, as the offset was off by one byte.

## overflow1.c
At the end of the `main` function, `gcc` produced the following assembly code:

```asm
nop
lea    -0x8(%ebp),%esp
pop    %ecx
pop    %ebx
pop    %ebp
lea    -0x4(%ecx),%esp
ret
```

The problem here is that a value is popped from the stack into `ecx` and an offset from that value is used as the new `esp`.
As we overwrite the stack with the buffer address, `esp` then points before the buffer instead of on the stack where the buffer address resides.
Thus, the `ret` instruction fetches the wrong address and the exploit doesn't work.

After having a lot of problems with this issue, I found a comment online suggesting to add the `-mpreferred-stack-boundary=2` compiler flag which instructs `gcc` to align on 4 bytes (2^2) instead of 16 bytes.
With this change, the same part of the assembly code was generated as follows:

```asm
nop
mov    -0x4(%ebp),%ebx
leave
ret
```

`leave` destroys a stack frame and thus restores the stack pointer from `ebp`.
Thus, `esp` has the good value after `leave` and the first value on the stack is the address of the buffer.
Therefore, `ret` jumps to the buffer address and thus to our shellcode.
