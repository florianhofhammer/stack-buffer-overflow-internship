This directory contains the code for reproducing the exercises described in the tutorial on 64 bit stack smashing by [Harold Rodriguez / superkojiman](https://blog.techorganic.com/about/).  
The tutorial can be found online:

* [Part 3](https://blog.techorganic.com/2016/03/18/64-bit-linux-stack-smashing-tutorial-part-3/)

For information on the setup, changes I made to the original code and my experiences with this code, please refer to my [notes in the base directory](../NOTES.md).
