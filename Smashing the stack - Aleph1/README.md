This directory contains the code for reproducing the exercises described in Aleph1's paper [Smashing the Stack for fun and profit](http://phrack.org/issues/49/14.html#article) published in the [Phrack magazine](http://phrack.org).

For information on the setup, changes I made to the original code and my experiences with this code, please refer to my [notes in the base directory](../NOTES.md).
