This directory contains the code for reproducing the exploits described in Tilo MÃ¼ller's paper [ASLR Smack & Laugh Reference](https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16401261).

For information on the setup, changes I made to the original code and my experiences with this code, please refer to my [notes in the base directory](../NOTES.html).
